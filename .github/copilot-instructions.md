This project is a Python application for analyzing audio and radio frequencies to detect leakage or obscured layers in layered networks. The program handles frequency datasets with 1Hz resolution and combines frequencies for network layer anomaly detection through advanced signal processing techniques.

## Project Structure
- `src/` - Main source code modules
- `data/` - Sample frequency data files
- `tests/` - Unit tests
- `main.py` - Main demonstration script

## Key Features
- Audio and radio frequency dataset management
- High-resolution frequency analysis (down to 1Hz)
- Advanced signal processing for layer detection
- Network anomaly identification using multiple algorithms
- Statistical and machine learning-based detection methods
- Comprehensive reporting and analysis

## Technical Stack
- NumPy, SciPy for signal processing
- Pandas for data management
- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for visualization

## Usage
Run `python main.pypython3 gui_app.py` to execute the main analysis pipeline. The system will automatically generate sample data if input files are not found.

## Development Notes
- Focus on performance optimization for large frequency datasets
- Use error handling for robust signal processing
- Maintain modular architecture for easy extensibility
